# Chain
Simulation based on prevoius project (https://github.com/Pmitrega/Atoms-sim). It arranges atom network as chain with gravity and Hooke law with friction linear to velocity difference of connected atoms. Atoms can be pulled by clicking on them - nearest atom is being pulled to cursor. Two atoms on edges can be only moved by mouse.
